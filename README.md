## Typescript vs. Dart

This git repository contains code for Group #2's project for CSCI 3415 Fall 2025: Principles of Programming languages.




**Each group project will be evaluated across two main components:
Presentation (with live code demonstrations)
Submitted Written Report (PDF)**

Additionally, each student must actively participate by presenting part of the project, answering questions, and showing individual contribution.

**Grading Rubric:
Category	Criteria	Weight (%)	Details / Expectations**
1. Language Analysis	Depth of comparison of syntax, semantics, data features, names & binding, data types, arithmetic expressions, control features, control structures, and subprograms	20%	Clear explanation of similarities and differences with examples
2. Code Implementation	Quality, correctness, and completeness of code examples in both languages	20%	Working code in both languages, demonstrates key features (control, subprograms, binding, etc.)
3. Presentation Delivery	Clarity, organization, use of visuals, engagement, time management	15%	Slides well-structured, concepts explained clearly
4. Individual Contribution	Each student presents, explains their part, and answers questions confidently	15%	Equal participation (5 students per group must all contribute)
5. Handling Questions	Ability to answer instructor/peer questions about project and code	10%	Shows deep understanding, not just reading slides
6. Written Report (PDF)	Organization, structure, depth of analysis, writing clarity	10%	Well-structured, academic tone, covers all required sections
7. Overall Teamwork	Evidence of collaboration, balanced workload, cohesiveness of project	10%	Presentation and report feel unified, not fragmented
Project Report (PDF) – Required Sections
Each group must submit a PDF report with the following structure:

**Cover Page**
Project title
Group number
Student names & IDs

**Abstract (½ page)**
Short summary of project goals, selected languages, and outcomes.

**Introduction (1–2 pages)**
Purpose of the comparison
High-level description of both languages

**Language Features Analysis (main section, 6–10 pages)**
Each subsection should compare both languages with examples:
Syntax and Semantics
Underlying Data Features
Names and Binding
Data Types
Arithmetic Expressions
Underlying Control Features
Control Structures
Subprograms (procedures/functions)
Implementing Subprograms (runtime handling, parameter passing, stack/closures)

**Implementation & Demonstration (4–10 pages)**
Code samples written in both languages
Screenshots of execution outputs
Explanation of design choices

**Discussion & Critical Analysis (2-5 pages)**
Strengths and weaknesses of each language
Which language handles features better and why
Reflection on ease of learning and practical use

**Conclusion (1 page)**
Summary of findings
Key takeaways

**References**
Official documentation links (provided)
Any textbooks, research papers, or tutorials used

**Presentation Guidelines**
Duration: 20–25 minutes per group
Format: Slides + live code demo
Participation: Each of the 5 students must:
Present at least one feature area
Show code they implemented
Answer at least one question during Q&A
